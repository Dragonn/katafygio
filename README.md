# katafygio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bpineau/katafygio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bpineau/katafygio)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/bpineau/katafygio)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/bpineau/katafygio)

**katafygio** discovers Kubernetes objects (deployments, services, ...),
and continuously save them as yaml files in a git repository.
This provides real time, continuous backups, and keeps detailled changes history.

## Usage

```bash
katafygio --git-url https://user:token@github.com/myorg/myrepos.git --local-dir /tmp/kfdump
```

The remote git url is optional: if not specified, katafygio will create a local
repository in the target dump directory. katafygio may be used that way to
quickly dump a cluster's content.

Filtering out irrelevant objects (esp. ReplicaSets and Pods) with `-x` and `-y`
will help to keep memory usage low. Same for low value and frequently changing
objects, that may bloat the git history.


```bash
# Filtering out replicasets and pods since they are managed by Deployments
# (already archived), endpoints (managed by Services), secrets (to keep them
# confidential), events and node (irrelevant), and the leader-elector
# configmap that has low value and changes a lot, causing commits churn.

katafygio \
  -g https://user:token@github.com/myorg/myrepos.git -e /tmp/kfdump \
  -x secret -x pod -x replicaset -x node -x endpoints -x event \
  -y configmap:kube-system/leader-elector
```
